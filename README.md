# PipeLine Extractor; CNC bend simulator; Angular UI;

Software for pipe bending machines. Creating a CNC program for the machine requires a pipeline. Typically, a 3D model of a pipe is provided by the customer in the STEP file format. STEP, which adheres to the ISO 10303-21 standard, can contain a wide variety of geometric data structures. The primary challenge is recognizing these data structures to accurately extract pipeline information.
